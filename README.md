# meCAN - Version 2023

## Arduino CAN Library

meCAN is an Arduino library that provides an easy-to-use interface for communicating over the Controller Area Network (CAN) bus. It has been designed to work with several STM32 microcontroller families, including STM32F0xx, STM32F1xx, STM32F4xx, and STM32L4xx.

The library allows you to control up to two CAN ports, with plans to support three ports in the future. It also supports receive interrupts on all ports and list and mask filters on all ports.
